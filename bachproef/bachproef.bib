  abstract     = {Quick response (QR) code, one of the two-dimensional barcodes, is now being widely used in all fields. The effectiveness of decoding, however, needs to be improved in real-time application. In most cases, the decoding procedure is time consuming, in which the detection of QR code plays an essential part. Therefore, this study proposes a fast detection method of QR code based on run-length coding: firstly, a novel approach is proposed to detect the minimum region containing position detection pattern (PDP) in QR code. Second, coordinates of central PDP in QR code are calculated by using run-length coding. The highlight in this step is the calculation, which utilises modified Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm. By this means, the computational complexity can be reduced tremendously. Finally, QR code can be detected successfully with the coordinates. The experimental results show that the proposed method is time saving and suitable for real-time application.},

  abstract  = {One of the problems pertinent with many visual cryptography (VC) schemes is that of authentication. VC provides a way of sharing secrets between a number of participants. The secrets are in the form of an image that is encoded into multiple pieces known as shares. When these shares are physically superimposed, the secret can be instantly observed. A known problem is that of authentication. How is it possible to know that the secret being recovered is genuine? There has been some work devoted to this using so called cheating prevention schemes which attempt to provide a means of traceability or authentication via a set of additional shares that are used to check authenticity. This paper proposes a scheme that attempts to alleviate this suspicion by using 2D barcodes as a means of authentication which may have more practicality in terms of real world usage. Results are provided using an application that is available on mobile devices for portable barcode reading.},

Wireless electronic software applications are developed in many different forms in order to facilitate marketing exchanges. Specifically, QR code reader applications now allow consumers to scan QR codes on virtually any flat surface. QR code scanner applications are expected to offer more creativity and are set to become even more popular. This study focuses on younger segment of retail consumers. By using an exploratory research approach, we concluded that: consumers liked QR codes and would continue to use them in the future; they enjoyed the convenience and speed of information offered by QR codes; and given some time and changes, they would embrace their usage. Convenience, functionality, standardization, information reliability, and security were listed as most important attributes for successful QR the code readers. We also found that QR code readers have the potential to be a viable alternative to cutting out coupons, mail-in promotions, computer screen browsing and physical store visits for researching products.},
